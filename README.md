# MachineLearning
This repository is simply a collection of a few of my experiments with AI. 

It includes the following:
* a perceptron with hill climbing and backpropogation
* a basic Feedforward Nerual Network (built from scratch)
* Flappy Bird AI implemented with Genetic Learning on my feedforward neural net
* A TicTacToe AI implemented with a Minimax tree
* A Connect4 AI implemented with a Minimax tree with Alpha Beta pruning and monte-carlo tree search
* A Checkers AI implemented with a Minimax tree with Alpha Beta pruning a feed forward value Neural Network which is trained from monte-carlo tree search
* A Markov Chain which can analyze scripts or books and then recreate stories from said scripts (including some sample Game of Thrones scripts).
