# MachineLearning
This repository is simply a collection of a few of my experiments with AI. 

It includes the following:
* A perceptron with hill climbing and gradient descent
* A basic Feedforward Nerual Network with genetics and gradient descent
* Flappy Bird AI implemented with Genetic Learning on my feedforward neural net
* A TicTacToe AI implemented with a Minimax tree
* A Connect4 AI implemented with a Minimax tree with Alpha Beta pruning and monte-carlo tree search on the value
* A Checkers AI implemented with a Minimax tree with Alpha Beta pruning a feed forward value Neural Network which is trained from monte-carlo tree search
* A Markov Chain which can analyze scripts or books and then recreate stories from said scripts (including some sample Game of Thrones scripts).
* A genetic algorithm which tries to replicate a source image using only non-overlapping triangles and quads.

Projects I have finished but are not included in this repository for different reasons:
* A Snake AI that plays in a 20x20 board and is trained with a Feed Forward Neural Network by taking in two 1x10 slices of the board around it's head as inputs
